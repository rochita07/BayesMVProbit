# Package Name:
“BayesMVProbit”


# Package Title:
Data augmentation Gibbs sampling for Multivariate Multinomial Probit model and Multivariate ordered Probit model


# Intended functionality / short description:

This package will implement the marginal data augmentation algorithms for posterior sampling in the Multivariate Multinomial Probit and Multivariate ordered Probit model. We consider the analysis of models for univariate and multivariate outcomes in the context of the latent variable inferential framework of Albert and Chib (1993) and Holmes and Held (2006). This will also provide trace plots of the parameters. The theories considered to build this package are mentioned in the reference section.


# Intended users: 

Mainly students working in Bayesian field with multivariate data. Specifically, this kind of models are mainly used in transportation system, Econometrics like labor economics (educational attainment), political economy (voter opinions), and health economics (consumers’ reliance on alternative sources of medical information) and so on.
